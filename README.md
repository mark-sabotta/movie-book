#Movie Book
Movie Book is an application which allows users to search for their favorite movies, rate them, and receive recommendations based on similar user choices. I created the application to showcase and further develop my skills in React, Node, Express, and mySQL.

The front end is routed using react-router-dom. It uses a single page application structure to make navigation feel faster and more fluid. The components are rendered by handling calls to a web API which lists movies and through RESTful routing of back-end calls for user and movie data stored in the application's database.

This application is not currently being hosted. If anyone is interested, I'd happily do a demo video to showcase the functionality which isn't yet apparent in the code. Though, a test version of the application is coming soon.
